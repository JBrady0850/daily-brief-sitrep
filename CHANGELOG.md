# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (2026-10-23)

First public version.

- Runs entirely on GitHub, free: `.github/workflows/daily-brief.yml` collects
  the news from Google News RSS and publisher feeds, builds the newsletter, and
  delivers it as a GitHub issue (no password) or by email through your own mail
  account, twice-daily UTC runs with a delivery-time gate for daylight saving
  time, and the no-repeat history in the Actions cache. No keys or paid services.
- Web app (GitHub Pages, home screen, or opened from disk): an eight-question
  setup interview, a category editor with a 22-category library and five starter
  packs, your own categories in plain words, newsletter preview, email draft
  (.eml), copy for email, settings file, backup and restore.
- Desktop app (`Start-Windows.bat`, `Start-Mac.command`, `start-linux.sh`):
  live news from Google News RSS and publisher feeds, the permanent no-repeat
  history, SMTP sending, a source health report, and scheduled runs with
  `python -m dailybrief run --send`.
- AI prompt for Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini and Grok: interview, run, update and
  JSON modes, Lead Analysis, SEEN HISTORY, and a compact version for
  size-limited instruction boxes.
- Newsletter theme: masthead, optional countdown with milestones, stat tiles,
  freshness bar, Lead Analysis, colour-coded category cards and freshness pills.
- Browser and Python engines tested against each other for identical results.
- Checked on live feeds and by an adversarial review before release: em dashes
  in feed headlines, a stricter career desk, a refused government feed removed,
  "Mark as read" no longer cancels the scheduled email, safer backup restore
  and mail settings, a once-a-day guard on "Email it now", unreadable dates left
  out, a faster no-repeat check, neutral examples, and prompt fixes for JSON
  mode, dates and settings order. See docs/ROADMAP.md, section 2.
